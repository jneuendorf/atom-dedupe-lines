# `dedupe-lines` Atom package

Removes duplicate lines from the current text editor (meaning the currently edited file).
The current line ending is kept if all lines have the same line ending (`LF` or `CRLF`).


## Install

```
apm install dedupe-lines
```


## Usage

- `cmd+shift+p` `>` `Dedupe` (should result in `Dedupe Lines: Dedupe`)
